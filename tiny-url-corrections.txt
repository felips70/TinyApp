 DONE * Add http to links when it does not exist already to ensure tiny url works correctly.

 DONE * We discussed that all users can access a short url. It seems this is part of the project but perhaps undesirable. I'll look into this.

 DONE * I was able to access the editing page when I wasn't logged in. This should only be for users who are logged in.

 DONE * head/navigation partials were pretty small, not really needed. (Not very 'dry' but I could see if app was more complex, these would be good to have)

 DONE * All ejs pages should not be able to access allUsers db. They should only have access to necessary variables.

 DONE * Switch list item to be directly under UL tag. (rather than having form as child)

 DONE * Update link to short code so redirection could be easily tested (rather than linking to long url)

 DONE * Don't send whole url database or 'allUsers' as template vars. Do lookup of variables required torender.This will help better separate logic.

 DONE * Try: delete req.session (for logout)

 DONE * For 'confirmLogin' function, perhaps rename to 'getUserId' to make it more explicit that userId is returned.

 DONE * For functions that return a value, ensure null is returned when not found.
